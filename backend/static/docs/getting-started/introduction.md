Welcome! Letâ€™s begin by introducing Demi. Demi is an interpreted JavaScript runtime language built on top of Deno. While Demi features a syntax distinct from JavaScript, it retains the full capabilities of JavaScript. It is continuously evolving and adapting to meet modern expectations of what a programming language should be.

Demi is crafted with simplicity and readability in mind, making it both easy to learn and use. While it is still in its early stages of development and not yet ready for production, it is already capable of executing most of the code you write.
<!-- Change this when development proceedes further -->

### Hello World Example
```demi
const variable = "Hello World!";
print(variable);
# Prints: Hello World!
```

## Installation

To get started, you will need to install Demi. You can either install pre-compiled binaries or you can compile from source.

In this chapter, we will learn to:
- Install Demi on Linux, MacOS, and Windows
- Writing your first program
- Using the Dim Package Manager (WIP)
