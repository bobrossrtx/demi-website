Welcome! To get started, lets explain what Demi is. Demi is an interpreted javascript runtime language
which is built on-top of Deno. This means that Demi, which is syntactically differet to Javascript is
capable of everything Javascript can do. It is always adapting and updating to fit within todays expectations
of what a programming language is.

To get started, you will need to install Demi. You can either install pre-compiled binaries or you can compile from source.

In this chapter, we will learn to:
- Install Demi on Linux, MacOS, and Windows
- Writing your first program
- Using the Dusk Package Manager (WIP)
